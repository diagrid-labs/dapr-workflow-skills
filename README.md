# Dapr Workflow Skills

This repository contains skill definitions that can be used with Claude Code to build Dapr Workflow applications.

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code)
- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- [C# LSP Plugin](https://claude.com/plugins/csharp-lsp)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation)
- [Dapr CLI](https://docs.dapr.io/getting-started/install-dapr-cli/)

## How to use this

- Clone this repo
- Open a terminal and navigate to the cloned repo
- Start Claude Code
- Use a prompt to build a Dapr workflow application (see the example below)
- Depending on your access permissions, you need to approve the usage of some tools during the generation of the .NET project.
- Inspect the README.md file in the new folder after creation of the project.

## Prompt example

Create a plan to build a Dapr workflow app in .NET. The workflow automates the onboarding process of a new employee. The first activity is employee registration, which creates a new employeeId in a data store. Then 4 activities are called in parallel:

  1. AddEmployeeToInternalCommsTool
  2. AddEmployeeToBenefitsProgram
  3. UpdateOrgChart
  4. SendWelcomePackage

The input for the workflow contains the following fields:

- First name
- Last name
- Address
- Department
  
The input records for the 4 parallel activities include the employeeId. The workflow output should include the employeeId.
